            <p>My name is Olivia Golden and I am a senior studying computer science and applied mathematics at CU Boulder.  Ever since I was young I enjoyed solving puzzles, specifically puzzles that require creativity.  Computer science is a perfect outlet for me, combining creativity with problem-solving. Within computer science, I am specifically interested in backend development. This past summer I worked as an intern to create a website that ran tests on the IBMi operating system.  This position was extremely rewarding, and I am looking forward to entering industry next year as a Backend Cloud Software Developer.   I am also interested in AI. I took a class called Intro to AI last semester and was able to get insight into what AI is and what it can be used for.  I am hoping to stay up to date with AI development, and maybe in the future, pursue a career in it. 
                Outside of computer science, I enjoy pursuing other creative endeavors such as painting and sculpting.  I also have a passion for film and photography and am currently taking a photography class here at CU. However, what I am most looking forward to as I graduate is traveling.  I believe that traveling gives access to new experiences and perspectives that help round a person. This summer I will be traveling to Europe for three weeks.  With this trip, I hope to learn more about myself and other cultures.
