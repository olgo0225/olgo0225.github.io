							<h1>Olivia Golden</h1>
							<p>My name is Olivia Golden and I am a senior studying computer science and applied mathematics at CU Boulder.  Ever since I was young I enjoyed solving puzzles, specifically puzzles that require creativity.  Computer science is a perfect outlet for me, combining creativity with problem-solving. Within computer science, I am specifically interested in backend development. This past summer I worked as an intern to create a website that ran tests on the IBMi operating system.  This position was extremely rewarding, and I am looking forward to entering industry next year as a Backend Cloud Software Developer.   I am also interested in AI. I took a class called Intro to AI last semester and was able to get insight into what AI is and what it can be used for.  I am hoping to stay up to date with AI development, and maybe in the future, pursue a career in it. </p>

								<h2>Autonomous Lung Biopsy Robot GUI (CAPSTONE) </h2>
								<p>Medtronic #2 has developed software that integrates a CT scan map of the patient's lungs to help a physician navigate a standard motor-controlled articulating catheter through a 2-d space of the lung bronchioles to the target lesion.  In addition, the physician has access to a view from the tip of the catheter within the patientâ€™s lung and in a virtual space. Procedures can be recorded and replayed for educational purposes. </p>

								<h2>MAXAR Simulation Documentation</h2>
								<p>The summer between my sophomore and junior year of college I worked at an aerospace company called Maxar.  I worked with the simulation team to document high-level Python code for wideband telemetry and monitored simulation instances. The code simulated retrieving encrypted telemetry data from a satellite, decrypting it, and relaying the information to the user.  I had to form a deep understanding of the code in order to simply and concisely relay it to a user who might not be familiar with Python code.</p>

								<p>My sophomore year of college I worked with a team of CU students to create a flight search software.  A user is able to search for the cheapest flights by inputting their destination and departure locations as well as their travel dates.  A user is also able to save results and view them later by logging into their account.  This project utilized an API called Skyscanner.</p>

								<h2>Undergraduate Research, Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder</h2>
								<p>My freshman year of college I worked as an Undergraduate researcher at CU Boulder.  The project was to create a model that predicted the terrestrial water cycle at a local to global scale.  I worked on verifying the results through validation and verification techniques.  I also interpreted data and created interactive graphs with Python.</p>
