In addition, the physician has access to a view from the tip of the catheter within the patientâ€™s lung and in a virtual space. Procedures can be recorded and replayed for educational purposes.

In addition, I updated the IBMi testing framework code to produce correct pass/fail results and composed bash shell scripts to automatically compile the different tests.

                    <div class="overlay-text">The summer between my sophomore and junior year of college I worked at an aerospace company called Maxar.  I worked with the simulation team to document high-level Python code for wideband telemetry and monitored simulation instances. The code simulated retrieving encrypted telemetry data from a satellite, decrypting it, and relaying the information to the user.  I had to form a deep understanding of the code in order to simply and concisely relay it to a user who might not be familiar with Python code.

A user is also able to save results and view them later by logging into their account.  This project utilized an API called Skyscanner.

I also interpreted data and created interactive graphs with Python.
